			<h4>👋🏻 Hey!</h4>
			<h4>I'm Melissa, an artist transitioning to tech at 48.</h4>
			<p>
				As a career-switcher, I'm pumped to bring my years of non-traditional
				experience to a team.
			</p>
			<p class="subtle">
				At some point I'll have carefully crafted sound-bites to describe why
				I'm making the change, which I expect to totally forget in an interview
				setting. That should be a real hoot.
			</p>

			<hr class="rounded" />
			<p class="soon">🔜 i'll add a headshot and list my skills</p>

			<hr class="rounded" />
			<h4>Here's my LinkedIn spiel:</h4>

			<p>
				I've been using my art skills and problem-solving abilities in the
				marketplace for over 20 years. Whether establishing an in-house art
				department at a local embroidery shop, writing and illustrating books
				for traditional publishers -- not to mention engaging in my own
				entrepreneurial pursuits -- I tackle challenges with enthusiasm,
				curiosity and a lot of coffee.
				<br /><br />
				I'm friendly and I love connecting with people.
				<br />
				I will probably ask you if you have any cats*.
			</p>

			<p class="soon">🔜 i'll add projects here</p>
