			<p>Hey! I'm Melissa, an artist transitioning to tech at the age of [REDACTED].</p>
			<p> As a
				career-switcher, I'm pumped to bring my non-traditional experience to a
				team.  I love learning and am told I ask good questions. 	
			</p>
			<p class="kindaSubtle bold">
				At some point I'll have carefully crafted sound-bites, which I expect to completely forget in an interview.

			<h4>Here's my LinkedIn spiel:</h4>

			<p>
				I've been using my art skills and problem-solving abilities in the
				marketplace for over 20 years. Whether establishing an in-house art
				department at a local embroidery shop, writing and illustrating books
				for traditional publishers -- not to mention engaging in my own
				entrepreneurial pursuits -- I tackle challenges with enthusiasm,
				curiosity and a lot of coffee.
				<br /><br />
				I'm friendly and I love connecting with people.
				<br />
				I will probably ask you if you have any cats*.

</ul>
<p><strong>With multiple people now tending to all of the critters</strong>, they need a way to keep track of when the dogs were last walked and fed, did they actually ingest their meds (or did they see right through the peanut butter ruse), did they go peeps and...</p>
<p>... to answer the all-important question,</p>
<p>üí© <strong>DID THEY POOP?</strong> üí©</p>
<p>Although texting each other or hollering up the stairs to find out is certainly a way to do it, PoopReport is less yell-y, more reliable and a whole lot cuter.</p>
